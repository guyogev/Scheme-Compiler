Scheme-Compiler
===============
Compiles a Chez scm file to CISC asm file.
The scm file syntax must be valid. syntax error will cause a crash.

A. About the compilation process:
-----------------------
    the program is a 4 stage process 
    1.  read the input file, parse it into AST with syntax-labeled(tagged) nodes.
    2.  the AST is analyzed syntactically, resulting a new AST with richer tag labels.
    3.  the AST scanned for user defined constants and symbols.
    3.  generate asm code of AST. 
    
B. Instructions:
----------------    
Compiling a Scheme file:
1.  download the project
2.  from the directory, run: python3 -i compiler.py
3.  from the prompt, compile_scheme_file("input", "output.asm").
    "input" is the Scheme file name.
    "output" is the desired output file name.
    
if compilation was successful, a file output.asm is created.
in order to run the output file you'll need GCC installed.

1.  from the directory, run: make output.asm
2.  run: ./output 

C. Compiling the example input.scm file:
----------------------------------------    
In Order to compile the example file run the commands:
1. python3 -i compiler.py
2. compile_scheme_file("input.scm", "output.asm")
3. make output
4. ./output
